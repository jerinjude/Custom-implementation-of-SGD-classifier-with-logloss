# Custom-implementation-of-SGD-classifier-with-logloss

Implemented a custom fuction to classify the data into two classes using basic python libraries like numpy and pandas.
The implementation was validated using a artificial dataset created using scikit learn.
The resulting weights and bias of custom implementation after training the classifier are very close to what the scikit-learn implementation provides.
